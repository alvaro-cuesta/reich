# TODO:

- Fix count 1 in Firefox

- Select start pattern
- Pause/resume?
- Get current position by phase shift instead of delta from start

- DDR Game
  - No game mode (just play)
  - Detect dual hits (as next hit? as wrong current hit?)
  - Adjust % in colors depending on %
  - x position depending on %
  - Calibration? Seems to be off! (might be fixed)
  - FIX: why there's no hit-bad ever?
  - HACK: timeStamp on event assumes DOMHighresTimeStamp which might not be available in all browsers https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/01/high-res-timestamps
  - Option to disable colors until end (no-distraction)
  - Mobile clicking
  - Statistics of fails etc. at game end
  - Clap1 included game mode? Interesting for duet or solo duet.
  - Audio tapping
